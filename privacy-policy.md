**We Collect No Personal Information Using Our Application**

**Sugar-Control-Diary is a local application, all your data is stored only on your device.**

You might also be asked to provide access to your photo library, but this is only so you can open your photos in Sugar-Control-Diary and save them back to your library. We donâ€™t process that information at all and have no access to it.

In addition, if you take a photo using Sugar-Control-Diary for iOS, location data is saved in the image, but we have no access to that data and it is not shared with anyone.
